Suggestions can also be made directly to me if you can find me on Discord, or on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/thedebbycase.bsky.social)!

If you wish you can also donate to me over on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thedebbycase)!

## WILDCARD

Thank you to WILDCARD and all members for making such great content and being a source of comfort and joy for me and many others. I can't lie and say I don't have my favourites (guess who) but I do hope to eventually have something to represent everyone!
